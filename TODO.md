## To Do

- Git Version Convention
    > By default `maven-publish` does some terrible timestamps in the version strings of snapshots. I should make the Gradle build use Git tags to figure out the version.
    * [ ] Copy Gradle code from Resoday
    * [ ] Convert it into a gradle/plugins convention plugin
    * [ ] use -SNAPSHOT instead of -dirty for Maven compatibility and such (still haven't figured out how versioning in Maven works exactly, *sigh*)
- Nexus Staging
    > There is a feature of Nexus that I don't quite grok yet. It should be useful when publishing release artifacts (non-snapshots).
    * [ ] Wait for https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-93975
    * [ ] Add stagingProfileId to build script
- Add .idea/logo.png
    > Just for fun! There's already a local branch with a design
- Foldable impl
    > https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.15.0.0/docs/src/Data-Foldable.html#Foldable
- Use switch-pattern-matching in either-java17 (preview feature)
    * [x] Wait until Java 17 is released
    * [ ] Wait until JDK with needed flag is available in Ubuntu https://stackoverflow.com/q/68702414/1083697
    * [x] https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/406 -- pattern matching is preview feature in Java 17
    * [ ] maybe in a separate module either-java17-samples?
- Kotlin: data class?
    > Already implemented, but need to check a couple of details.
    * [ ] Are data classes a good idea for Left and Right? Left#a and Right#b seemingly make it too attached to <A, B> type parameter naming
    * [ ] are data classes with all fields private  possible?
    * [ ] data class Left(private val a: A) ???
- Add Haskell type notation to Javadocs
    > Not sure if it would be useful - it would confuse people not familiar with Haskell.
- either-java8 JSON
    > Since we'll make classes Serialiazeable, there should be a JSON serialization implementation for popular JSON libraries.
    * [ ] either-java8-gson -- not possible, because of type erasure -- but we could help users make their own Json(De)Serializers, maybe
    * [ ] either-java8-jackson
    * [ ] either-java17-gson -- Gson already supports records, so should be fine-ish
    * [ ] ???
- kotlin-mpp
    * [ ] https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mpp-create-lib.html
    * [ ] https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-library.html
- Kotlin testing frameworks
    * [ ] look into https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/kotlin.test/
    * [ ] look into https://kotest.io/
- jar manifest
    > Figure out adding information to the manifest files of the published jars. Especially the implementation version field.
- Maybe toOptional()?
    > A method that discards Left and wraps Right into an Optional.of
- JMH microbenchmarks
    * [ ] does kotlin's `inline` have an effect?
- Consider publishing Javadocs on the web
    * [ ] Option 1: https://github.com/ajoberstar/gradle-git-publish
- Include LICENSE.md in jar
    > Similarly to "Copy Commit Reference" plugin for IntelliJ, it won't hurt if LICENSE.md was included in the jars.

## Doing

- add code samples
    * [ ] code samples in README
    * [x] code samples as separate subproject
- Move EitherStreams to a separate jar
    > Not sure if this is a good idea, but the inter-operation with Stream doesn't seem like a popular use-case for Either.  Same applies for the collections in the Kotlin version.
    * [ ] Comparator could also be in that separate jar.
    * [ ] Maybe name it "either-<variant>-utils"
    * [ ] Comparator and Streams/Collection support  could be moved to samples -- galaxy brain move to use samples as a preview/staging for possible upgrade to the API status. It helps that neither of the expansions (and probably almost none at all) need package-private access, and can be implemented on the  "outside".
- equals & hashCode & Serializable
    > Stalled while I figure out publishing
    * [x] Serializable
    * [x] Tests for serialization
    * [x] equals & hashCode
    * [x] tests for equals & hashCode
    * [x] merge to main
    * [ ] add documentation for equals and hashCode explaining dependence on types `A` and `B` implementing equals and hashCode
    * [ ] kotlin version
    * [ ] merge to main

## Done

- Move src to either-java8/ subproject
    * [x] Gradle: add JVM version to the build script
- Add README.md
- Move java8 and java17 impls into separate packages to disambig
    > Seem to have hit an IntelliJ bug -- IDEA wants to add more classes to `permits` of Either in java17 version
- Kotlin impl
    * [x] learn about Kotlin Generics
- Add either-java16 or whatever version with sealed classes (possibly experimental)
- Maybe move static functions into a separate class(es)
    * [x] EitherTypeClasses?
    * [x] can't think of class name for functions `either` -- they are just convenience functions, with slightly different type than match
- Kotlin tests
- Javadocs for static factory methods `left` and `right`
- pre-push hook
    > https://stackoverflow.com/a/61621713/1083697
- Gradle: task configuration avoidance
    > compare how task `test` is configured in kotlin and java versions
    * [x] stop using plain `test { ... }` block
- Gradle update/cleanup 2021-09
    * [x] upgrade junit version
    * [x] clean up build script for Kotlin plugin
- Upgrade to Gradle 7.6
- Upgrade Kotlin Gradle plugin
- MIT License
    > I've decided that either-jvm isn't worth keeping under LGPL
    * [x] figure out SPDX ID stuff
    * [x] delete all copyright comments in code
    * [x] replace COPYING and LICENSE with MIT license
- Gradle: specify --release for javac
    > Implemented in commit af9bdcf (either-java8: clean up Gradle build script, 2021-08-07)
- Java 17 EitherStreams
    > Pretty much a copy of -java8 version. The only difference I've noticed is List.of and Stream.toList usage possibility in the tests.
    * [x] WIP in local branch
- Set up publishing
    > Use Gradle plugin maven-publish for publishing of jars to Maven repositories
- Check generics
    > Does something like Either need PECS applied to generics in method `match`, for example? One might consider Either as a collection of elements of type A or B.
    * [x] see branch `generics` on GitHub/GitLab
    * [x] Kotlin
- method that takes two Consumers
    * [x] Method name candidates: accept, process, handle, apply, execute
    * [x] peek
    * [x] accept
    * [x] either-kotlin implementation
    * [x] add documentation comments
    * [x] merge to `main`
- Publish something
    > Version 0.2-SNAPSHOT has been published!
    * [x] do I need an account for Maven Central or something
    * [x] See local notes
- Fix Javadocs
    > It seems that {@link A} for type params in Javadoc is rendered badly. It needs to be fixed. I've reported the bug, it got "internal review ID : 9075760".
    * [x] Find if there's a JDK ticket about it
    * [x] remove @links for type params
    * [x] remove [A] links for type params in Kotlin
- Merge publishing
    > Version 0.2.0-SNAPSHOT has been published from a branch with WIP code for publishing. It needs to be cleaned up and merged to main.
    * [x] Clean up publishing code
    * [x] Test publishing again
    * [x] merge to 'main'
